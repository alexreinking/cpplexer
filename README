CPP-Lexer
---------

This is a simple tokenizer class for C/C++. It doesn't handle line splices in start-comments, but since this is a (rare) misfeature, it shouldn't cause any problems in practice.

The class is packaged with a decent syntax highlighter that outputs well-formed HTML 4.

This was written during my Junior year of high school.
